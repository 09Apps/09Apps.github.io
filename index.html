                Swapnil is a seasoned IT professional with a strong health insurance background. I found him to be very flexible and easy to work with. He anticipates all the client needs and rounds up his resources to deliver a seamless solution. He is extremely detail oriented with a clear understanding of high level picture. He led the delivery of a large program for my team and successfully delivered the program. His leadership had been instrumental in keeping the program on track under very challenging condition.
